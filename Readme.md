# Custom Document class for latex

## Usage
Set environment variable TEXMFHOME to the path where this folder (tex) is located. This is required, because otherwise Latex will not find the custom classes. Also the structure tex/latex/ is fixed and cannot be changed. So at the end the document class(es) are located in $TEXMFHOME/tex/latex
