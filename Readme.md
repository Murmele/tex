# Custom Document class for latex
This is my personal document class for latex. Feel free to reuse it.

## Usage
1) Set environment variable TEXMFHOME to the path where this folder (tex) is located. This is required, because otherwise Latex will not find the custom classes. Also the structure tex/latex/ is fixed and cannot be changed. So at the end the document class(es) are located in $TEXMFHOME/tex/latex
2) See Document class file (.cls) for further instructions how to use it
